This repository provides resources to get started with an understanding of diffusion models. 

The repository features: 

* A Jupyter notebook with an initial paper on Diffusion Models ([Deep Unsupervised Learning using Non equilibrium Thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585)) 
* A checkpoint from a trained model


For a related notebook, with a model trained on a real dataset (i.e. building facades), see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aurioldegbelo/2025-diffusion-model-for-facades).
